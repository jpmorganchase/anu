# Anu

Anujs is an immersive data visualization toolkit built on the web-based 3D game engine [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/). Anu is heavily inspired by [D3's](https://d3js.org/) data-binding DOM manipulation patterns and visualization utility. Anu works in synergy with D3 to bring these patterns to Babylon, enabling developers to dynamically manipulate the Babylon scene graph with data and augment 3D immersive visualizations with utilities, pre-fabs, and interactions.
