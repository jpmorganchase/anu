# Make it Yours!

You now should have what you need to start creating visualization with Anu! Use this page as a starting point to keep exploring. Weâ€™ve added a new folder full of data curated from the vega-datasets project, and a few more. Using this data either remix the visualization we made previous or make something entirely new! Below we will include some helpful links, such as our example gallery, to help inspire you and to reference even more topics not yet covered in this tutorial.

Also feel free to download the template at this point to work on your own code-editor locally if you would prefer. If you would like to share your creation we would love to see it! Please feel free to post anything you create on our github discussion forum! If you have any questions that is also the best place to ask them and get help from us directly.
