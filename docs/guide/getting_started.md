Before diving in, let's go over some background, installation, and set-up to make sure you have the best experience using Anu.

### Need to Know

 1. The basics of web development - JS/HTML/CSS.
 2. How to set up and use Babylon.js to create 3D scenes and meshes.
 3. What Node.js is and how to use it.

Dive in without these you may find shallow water and angry stack overflow :mage:

## Installation
We recommend following the [Babylon + Vite](https://doc.babylonjs.com/guidedLearning/usingVite) guide to set-up your Babylonjs project.

Once your project structure is up and running, install Anu.js by building it locally in a different file directory and linking it to your project.

```bash
npm install @jpmorganchase/anu
```

Then import the anu name space

```js
import * as anu from '@jpmorganchase/anu';
```

You can now call anu methods as such

```js
//shape, name, options, data, scene
anu.create('box', 'myBox');
```

### Or Use The Anu-Starter Template

```bash
npx @jpmorganchase/anu-starter@latest my_project
```

```bash
cd my_project
npm install
npm run dev
```

See and modify main.js to get started.
